# Classifying_movie_reviews_using_NLP
## Step One 

-  NLP
- How to determine if a review is positive or negative?
- We use the Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 could be considered a positive review. A review of 1 or 2 could be considered negative and a review of 3 is nuetral and ignored. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) of a review.
